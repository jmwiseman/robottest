The robot is driven using arcade controls on the right joystick on the first
joypad (axis 1 is steering and axis 2 is forward/reverse).
axis 3 controls the convayer (but it probably needs to be heavily scaled)
button 7 up (should be 6 up) is /supposed/ to controll the launcher but were
struggling with that.
motors: see robot.h dont look here as this file wont be updated

TODO
	scale axis, the robot does not need to go that fast
	soften motor acceleration (this probably needs multithreading)
	all of the autonomous code
	button for launcher
