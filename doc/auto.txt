we currently are just startung out with the line following code which will
make up the majority of the navigation
I plan on bringing the vishay IR transivers to the upcoming meeting so we can
start on the becon based navigation code to supplement this
see robot.h for sensor connections
we talked about using ultrasonic sensors earlier and will probably use them so
we dont have to run the conveyer and launcher all the time which will wear on
the batteries.
